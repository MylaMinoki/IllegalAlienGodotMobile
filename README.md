He comes across a kind man named Javier who helps him after the two are chased from the crash site by a local police officer. Javier is undocumented, so if he is arrested he could be deported. He is a local handyman living out of a shack near the small town called Border Town. He has to check in once a month with the local judge who is allowing him to be here. If he misses his check in, he will also be deported. He’s sending money back home to his family who are trying to legally cross the border. His citizenship test is in 1 year and he needs to both pay the fee and not get arrested in that time and then he gets a Visa to stay in the country.
